üéØ Design Goals
Create an intuitive and clean interface for all users.

Ensure mobile and desktop responsiveness.

Minimize steps needed to browse, view, and book properties.

Provide clear calls to action (e.g., "Book Now", "View Details").

Maintain visual consistency and accessibility throughout the platform.

üîë Key Features to Implement
Simple and responsive navigation.

Property cards with thumbnails, prices, and short descriptions.

Search and filtering options to refine listings.

A detailed property page with full images, amenities, host info, and reviews.

A secure and minimal checkout flow for booking confirmations.

üìÑ Primary Page Descriptions
Page Name	Description
Property Listing View	Displays a grid or list of all available properties. Users can search, filter, and scroll through available options. Key info (price, title, image) is visible at a glance.
Listing Detailed View	Shows a selected property in detail: images, full description, host info, amenities, location map, and user reviews. Includes a prominent ‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù button.
Simple Checkout View	Final step for booking. Displays a summary of the selected property, total cost, date range, and payment form. Clear and minimal interface to reduce friction.

üë• Importance of a User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design ensures that users can navigate the booking system efficiently without confusion or frustration. It builds trust, reduces drop-offs during checkout, and improves overall satisfaction. In a competitive space like property bookings, great UX directly impacts conversions and customer loyalty.

üìå Why Identifying Design Properties Matters
Understanding and documenting design properties like colors, fonts, and sizes ensures consistency across your application. It helps developers implement the UI accurately, speeds up collaboration between designers and developers, and ensures a polished and professional user experience. It also allows future changes to be made quickly and uniformly across the app.
